Please run the following commands to set up the food agent:

1. Install the package:
   `make install`

2. Register the MCP server:
   `make register`

**IMPORTANT:** Once the installation and registration are complete, you MUST restart Gemini for the new tools to be available in your session:
- Type `/quit` to exit.
- Restart with `gemini -r` (to restore your session) or simply `gemini`.

**Final Step:** Once you've restarted, please describe something you've eaten today (e.g., "I had a cup of coffee and a bagel") to verify the agent is working and to log your first entry!

Refer to README.md for more details and troubleshooting.
